/*
	 Print Subsets of Array 
	 Given an integer array (of length n), find and print all the subsets of input array.
	 
	 Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array.
	 But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
	 Note : The order of subsets are not important. Just print the subsets in different lines.
	
	Sample Input:
				3
				15 20 12
	
	Sample Output:
				12 
				20 
				20 12 
				15 
				15 12 
				15 20 
				15 20 12
